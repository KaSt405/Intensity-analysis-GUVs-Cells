ImageJ macro for analysis of objects like cells or GUVs. Not usable for time series.
If the file for analysis is a z-stack, it will be converted to a maximum intensity projection for analysis.

One image channel can be selected, which will define the area for the intensity measurement via thresholding, that can be entered.
Channels whose intesity should be measured in the defined area, can be selected.

IMPORTANT: Close all files in ImageJ before using the macro, then open the file for analysis.
